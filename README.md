# American Express Coding Challenge

For this challenge, I made axios requests to the json file provided to get the data to generate the React components. This has been deployed to Heroku at the link [here](https://amex-star-wars-challenge.herokuapp.com/) using Travis for continual integration.

To run this locally:

1. npm install
  - Requires at least Node version 7.0
2. npm run start-dev


To run tests:
1. npm test

Thank you for your consideration.
